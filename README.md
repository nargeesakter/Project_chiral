## Abstract
Thalassemia is one of the most common autosomal recessive hereditary blood disorders worldwide, especially in developing countries, including Bangladesh. Thus, this study aimed to determine HRQoL and its determinants of thalassemia patients (TP) in Bangladesh. A cross-sectional survey was performed on 356 randomly selected thalassemia patients. Participants were invited to face-to-face interviews. Descriptive statistics (frequencies and percentages), independent t-test, ANOVA, and multivariate (linear and logistic regression) analysis was performed to analyze the data. Our demographic data showed that among 356 patients, 54% and 46% were male and female, respectively, with an average age of 19.75 (SD= 8.02) years. Most were transfusion-dependent (91%), 26% had comorbidities, and 52% were from low-income families. In the case of HRQoL, male patients showed signifcantly higher scores of bodily pains and physical health summaries than female patients. Lower income, high blood transfusion status, disease severity, comorbidities, and medical expenses (p< 0.05; CI 95%) are signifcantly associated with lower SF-36 scores. This study found an association between lower income, blood transfusion, disease severity, comorbidities, as well as medical expenses, and the deterioration of HRQoL among TP. Male patients experienced poorer HRQoL than females. National action plans are required to guarantee the holistic welfare of thalassemia patients.
